\section{Objectives}
the objective of the project is to process files in IFC format containing building meshes that are not hermetic in an algorithms repairing
geometric error in a kinetic data structures
\section{Tools}
\subsection{CGAL}
CGAL is a package for geometry algorithms,offering differents data structure and algorithms
to work on polygons,surface,mesh generation... 
\subsection{Kinetic}
Kinetic algorithms is a package from CGAL, he permit to work on mesh with some hole in it .
When applied on the mesh the Kinetic algorithms will 'prolonger' some surface to fill the mesh to make it 
waterproof.
we can see here what the algorithm is capable of :
