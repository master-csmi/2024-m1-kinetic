\section{Objectives}
the objective of the project is to process files in IFC format containing building meshes that are not hermetic in an algorithm repairing
geometric error in a kinetic data structures.
\newline In the first part of the project we need to repair building to make them watertight, keep the label of the differents materials.
In the second part, we will need to use the algorithm on an urban model and ensure that adjacent buildings have no gaps between them. 
\section{Tools}
\subsection{CGAL}
CGAL is a package for geometry algorithms,offering differents data structure and algorithms
to work on polygons,surface,mesh generation... 
\subsection{Kinetic}
Kinetic algorithms is a package from CGAL, he permit to work on mesh with some hole in it .
When applied on the mesh the Kinetic algorithms will 'prolonger' some surface to fill the mesh to make it 
waterproof.
we can see here what the algorithm is capable of :
