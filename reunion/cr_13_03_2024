Zoom Meeting Chabannes Vincent,Alliez Pierre, Geraldes Pereira, Demuth Axel

Introduction to the CGAL package, a C++ library to perform geometric calculations.

Introduction to the Kinetic algorithm, which allows fixing a mesh to make it "watertight", meaning to close the gap betwwen the different surface in the mesh 

We need to work on how to use the CGAL package in C++. Later, we will need to be able to read IFC files. We can also start reading documentation on the kinetic program to learn how it works and how to use it.

One of the goals of the project is to apply the Kinetic algorithm to house meshes and to keep the label of the surfaces
